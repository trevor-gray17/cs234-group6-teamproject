# Basketball Team Management System

The Basketball Team Management System is a Java-based application designed to help basketball coaches or team managers keep track of their team's roster, player statistics, and more. This system allows for the addition, editing, and removal of players from the team roster, as well as viewing and managing detailed shooting statistics for each player. It features a user-friendly graphical interface for easy navigation and management of team data.
